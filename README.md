# RV32I-Logisim
## Introduction
Logisim allows you to design and simulate digital circuits. It is intended as an educational tool, to help you learn how circuits work. This is the implementation of RISC-V base ISA RV32I.
## Pre-requesits
You need to install [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and [Java Run-time Environment](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-jre#2-installing-openjdk-jre) to run the simulation on logisim by running the following commands.  
  
  
For Ubuntu run the following set of commands.

    sudo apt install logisim; sudo apt install default-jre; java -version

## Design
This implementation can help the beginners of RISC-V to get started. The circuit includes
- PC
- Register File
- ALU
- ALU Control
- Control Unit
- Immediate generation
- Memories (data and inst)
